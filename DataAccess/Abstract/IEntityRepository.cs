but in this case we can use anything with references with T hence we added IEntity there which means only the ones that are
implemented by IEntity or IEntity itself can be used with T, but since IEntity here is a abstract class that is interface we
don't want it to be used with T  therefore we add new() there to only use the ones that are implemented by IEntity reason why we use it
because interfaces are not able to be new() that's why.*/
